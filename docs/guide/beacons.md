## What is an iBeacon?

An iBeacon is a small Bluetooth device (Bluetooth Low Energy - BLE, Bluetooth 4.0) which sends out it's identification regularily. The iBeacon standard was introduced by Apple Inc. in 2013. It is supported by iOS. iBeacons can be purchased as standalone devices or to be used in connection with computer equipement.

If you position 3/4 iBeacons in a room, your 2/3-dimensional position can be calculated based on the signal strengths received.
